<b><h2>GFHL Point System:</h2></b>
<p>We use a Head-to-Head format instead of the common point structure. Each week you will go head to head 
against another team in a 3 game series. The team with the most points will get the W. If a team wins by 
more then or equal to 150 points within a week he will be 3-0-0 for the week and the losing team will be 
0-3-0. If a team wins by 101-149 points, then the winning team will be 2-0-1 for the week and the losing 
team will be 0-2-1.  If a team wins by 16-100 points then the winning team will be 2-1-0 for the week and 
the losing team will be 1-2-0. A tie occurs when teams are within 15 GS points of each other.  If teams 
tie for the week then they will both be 1-1-1.  If point difference is a decimal, then 0.5 and up will be rounded up, while under 0.5 will be rounded down.</p>
<p>We will use normal NHL points for standings W=2 pts, L=0 pts, T=1 pt</p>
<p>We will be using the following point system...</p>

<div class="text">
<b><h2>Rules Committee:</h2></b>
<p>The Rules Committee is comprised of the GFHL Commissioner, the 2 Deputy Commissioners and 4 elected General Managers.  The elected GMs are elected by the entire league and serve 2-year terms.  Elections take place at the end of the season in even number years.
</p>
</div>
<br />
<div class="text">
<b><h2>The Competitive Rule:</h2></b>
<p>GM's are expected to ice the best team possible. GM's should not have an NHL active player on their reserves while having a non-NHL player on their active roster. Consequences for not adhering to this condition once it is brought to their attention is the following:</p>
<p><ul><b>1 week late:</b> Loss of 2nd rounder (highest ranked pick available at that time)</ul></p>
<p><ul><b>2 weeks late:</b> Loss of 1st rounder (highest ranked pick available at that time)</ul></p>
<p><ul><b>3 weeks late:</b> Loss of next year's 1st (highest ranked pick available at that time)</ul></p>
<p><ul><b>4 weeks late:</b> GM removal...new GM receives back the picks lost and has one week to make the necessary changes.</ul></p>
<p><b>NOTE:</b> If the GM has already traded away or lost a pick(s) then the League will move to the next consequence in line. After a player has been requested to be moved off an active roster spot, the GM most provide documented evidence that the player has been called up to the NHL.</p>
</div>
<br />
<div class="text">
<b><h2>Competitive Review:</h2></b>
<p>All teams are expected to field their most competitive roster at any given time in a season, failure to do so will be subject to a review from the rules committee.  If questionable roster move(s) (including but not limited to: burying better players in reserve than are in active, inactive players on active roster, placing star player in ENF spot etc) are brought to the committee's attention either from a committee member or another GM the committee will investigate, ask the offending GM for an explanation of their move and then deem if the moves are ok or deemed to affect a teams competitiveness (meaning moves altered a teams standings for that week or are expected to alter a teams standing in the future).  Sanctions for these actions can include (but not limited too) removal from the draft lottery selection, removal of draft picks or even removal of GM from the league</p>
<br />
<div class="text">
<b><h2>Long Term Injury Reserve (LTIR):</h2></b>
<p>Any player that has been on LTIR in the NHL for more than a year can be subjected to committee review to determine the activity and roster eligibility of that player. If it's believed that player's career is over (ie Chris Pronger/Marc Savard) then the player will need to be released from the team's roster and cannot be signed</p>
<br />
<div class="text">
<b><h2>Trade Rules:</h2></b>
<p>To make each trade official, all participating GMs must submit an email to the league office to 
confirm the deal (<a href="mailto:gfhl22@hotmail.com?subject=GFHL Trade">gfhl22@hotmail.com</a>).</p>
<p>In an effort to cut down on one-sided trades, the Rules Committee will examine any trades which 
are deemed unfair by either the commissioner or any other general manager who objects to a specific 
transaction. Their job is not to stop or even slow down trading, but to stop one-sided deals and 
keep the GFHL a fair league</p>
<p>It is normal or one GM to make a trade that looks crazy but has reasons (going for youth etc...). 
If during the review period one of the GMs involved wishes to withdraw the deal before the rules 
committee votes on it then the deal is nullified.</p>
<p><b>Trade Review</b> - When a trade is questioned or falls under the automatic trade review category 
(see below) the commissioner will consult any random two committee members about the trade.  If any of 
them object to the deals fairness it will go before the entire committee for a full review.</p>
<p><b>A trade is automatically reviewed if they meet the following criteria:</b></p> 
<p><ul><b>a) have only prospects or picks on one side (no established players), or</b></ul></p>
<p><ul><b>b) have two or more prospects on one side (with established players or not)</b></ul></p>
<p><b>The only exceptions being (1) one prospect for one prospect, (2) one prospect for pick(s), or (3) pick(s) for pick(s) deals.</b></p>
<p>These trades are subject to immediate review by the Rules/Trade Committee to ensure fair play and 
competitiveness.  In such a case, both/any GMs involved will be asked to submit their rationale for 
agreeing to the deal and any information they feel appropriate to help the committee understand their 
reasoning. During the review process if one of the GMs involved has had a change of heart they may 
exercise their right to withdraw from the deal, however if the committee announces that they have 
accepted the deal then the deal is viewed as finalized and no party can then withdraw from it. Trades not confirmed within 48 hours will be deleted.</p>
</div>
<br />
<div class="text">
<b><h2>Future Considerations:</h2></b>
<p>Compensation for future considerations can only be in the form of draft picks, not players.</p>
</div>
<br />
<div class="text">
<b><h2>Re-Acquiring a Former Player:</h2></b>
<p>Any team that trades any player must wait one full calendar year before they can re-acquire this player in another trade.</p>
</div>
<br />
<div class="text">
<b><h2>Third round picks can be traded:</h2></b>
<p>In order to assist with asset management, non-playoff teams can now trade their third round 
picks. These picks are only available from the end of the season until the trade freeze prior 
to the GFHL draft. They will be tracked and monitored on the "Draft Info" page.</p>
</div>
<br />
<div class="text">
<b><h2>New GMs:</h2></b>
<p>New GMs will have a 1 week trade freeze when they join while they adjust to the league. The 
first 3 trades of a new GM will be subjected to automatic trade review.</p>
</div>
<br />
<div class="text">
<b><h2>Roster Updates:</h2></b>
<p>Trade, Free Agent Signings, Player drops, Waiver Claims and Roster Moves may be updated on a 
daily basis depending on the schedule of the League Office Commissioners, but will always be 
done on Mondays and Thursdays (unless otherwise announced). All transactions MUST be submitted 
by 6:00pm EST on Mondays and Thursdays to have the stats server (Officepools) updated and allow 
your players to collect points. While transactions may be updated on the website more frequently, 
the stats server will be updated ONLY on <b>MONDAYS and THURSDAYS</b>. Failure to have your transactions 
submitted by <b>6:00pm EST</b> on these days will detain your transactions from being updated in the stats 
server until the following update day.  Correct transactions are the GMs responsibility.  Incorrect transactions will not be updated.  When multiple teams attempt a signing or making a waiver claim on the same player, if a GMs neglects to provide a correct roster move then we will move onto the next eligible team.</p>
</div>
<br />
<div class="text">
<b><h2>Free Agent Signings:</h2></b>
<p>It has become very difficult too keep up with all the Free Agents, so if someone is 
not on the player database or on a team, he is a Free Agent and you can sign him first come first serve. However, if you try to sign a Free Agent and he is not a Free Agent there will be a penalty which is as follows: </p>
<p><ul><b>1st offense</b>- Warning</ul></p>
<p><ul><b>2nd offense</b>- one week no roster moves</ul></p>
<p><ul><b>3rd and etc... offense</b>- two weeks no roster moves</ul></p>
<p><b>Free Agent (definition):</b> A free agent is a player who's rights are held by an NHL team 
(has already been drafted or signed by an NHL team), but is not currently on any of the GFHL 
rosters OR the player is undrafted and/or unsigned by an NHL team, 22 years old or more, and 
not currently listed on any of the GFHL team rosters.</p>
<p>You must send an email to the League Office to sign Free Agents. As noted earlier, there 
is a ONE Free Agent limit per day until the season starts. If you sign a player on a Free 
Agent form and he is not a Free Agent you are subject to penalty.  See above for details.  The 
league office email is <a href="mailto:gfhl22@hotmail.com">gfhl22@hotmail.com</a> </p>
</div>
<br />
<div class="text">
<b><h2>Waiver Claims:</h2></b>
<p>After a player is released there is a 48hr window that will let teams submit a claim 
for him. The team with lowest point total in the standings will determine which team has 
the successful claim.</p>
</div>
<br />
<div class="text">
<b><h2>Pre-Draft Information:</h2></b>
<p>Following the trade deadline, no team is allowed to trade, sign or claim off waivers any player until the conclusion of the GFHL playoffs. </p>
<p>GM's can freely trade draft picks for the current season we are in and the season 
after that.  Once the current draft has been completed, the following draft picks 
will be added to each teams draft picks.  For example, once the 2010 draft is completed, 
all teams will have the 2012 picks added to their draft picks (any of the 2011 picks they 
currently own) and they can be freely moved if so desired.</p>
<p>Prior to the waiver/entry draft, GMs will be required to submit their protected/unprotected 
lists to the League Office by the appointed date and time. As all of the GMs submit their 
lists to the League Office, the rosters will be marked with * next to the names of players 
that are being unprotected for the draft. Should any team not submit their lists to the League 
Office on-time, the offending GM jeopardizes his position in the league and could be subject 
to removal from his post.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Non-playoff teams from the previous season can protect 17 players during the summer 
waiver/entry draft.  Playoff teams from the previous season can only protect 16 players.</p>
<p>Following the draft, teams must reduce their roster to the mandatory maximum of 24 
players as noted below.  Once the season begins all 20 active players will earn points for 
your team.  Players held in each team's reserve slots (RES) do not earn points unless 
activated to an appropriate roster slot at Forward, Defense, Enforcer/Utility or Goalie.</p>
<p><b>--Notice--</b></p>
<p>Any player with a noted asterisk ("*") beside his name is available to be selected during the GFHL waiver/entry draft.</p>
<p>In the 24 player roster, players that play multiple positions (i.e. defense and forward) must 
be monitored by the individual GMs to ensure that their player is playing in the most appropriate 
spot.  A defenseman cannot be placed in the forward position, a defenseman cannot be active in the 
forward slot, and a goalie can not be placed anywhere except the allowed GOL or RES spots.  If there 
is a roster violation that is not caught by the individual GM, then they will be notified by the 
League Office of the violation and requested to remedy the situation via a roster move.  It is up 
to the individual GMs to adjust their rosters if a roster violation is brought to their attention.  
Should they fail to do so, their roster will be frozen from collecting points until the appropriate 
changes are made.</p>
</div>
<br />
<div class="text">
<b><h2>The 30/15 Rule:</h2></b>
<p>No team shall be allowed to have more than 8 players on its roster (including reserves) that have 
played fewer than 30 NHL games (forwards/dmen/enforcers) or 15 NHL games (goalies). Individual GMs 
will be responsible for ensuring that their own team fits into this requirement. Prior to each 
season, GMs will be required to provide the league (via an email to the league office) with a list 
of players who don't meet the 30/15 requirement. Consequences for not adhering to this condition 
once it is brought to their attention is the following:</p>
<p><ul><b>1 week late:</b> Loss of 2nd rounder</ul></p>
<p><ul><b>2 weeks late:</b> Loss of 1st rounder</ul></p>
<p><ul><b>3 weeks late:</b> Loss of next year's 1st</ul></p>
<p><ul><b>4 weeks late:</b> GM removal...new GM receives back the picks lost and has one week to make the necessary changes.</ul></p>
<p><b>NOTE:</b> If the GM has already traded away or lost a pick(s) then the League will move to the next consequence in line.</p>
</div>
<br />
<div class="text">
<b><h2>The Defector or Experienced Veteran Rule:</h2></b>
<p><ul><b>Defector or Experienced Veteran:</b>:  A “defector” player is a former NHL player, who meets 30/15 requirements, and has gone overseas to play in another professional league.  An Experienced Veteran is any unrestricted free agent who meets 30/15 requirements, that has not been able to obtain a professional contract and has not yet retired.  Teams are only permitted to have at most 1 of either of these players on their roster and they MUST be placed in the reserve spots during the season.  These players will also be counted as part of their 30/15 limit.</p>
</div>
<br />
<div class="text">
<b><h2>Pre-Draft Duties of the League Office</h2></b>
<p>In addition to updating each team's roster unprotected/protected player listings, the League Office will advise GMs of the 
final order of draft pick selections following the conclusion of the regular season, and will conduct the lottery for placing 
of the first five selections of the draft. This is done by holding a draft lottery to determine the first overall selection for 
the GFHL Waiver/Entry Draft.</p>
</div>
<br />
<div class="text">
<b><h2>Draft Lottery Weighing System...</h2></b>
<p>The GFHL lottery will be eligible to NON-PLAYOFF teams only and they will be ordered according to accumulated points as reflected in the standings for each conference. Following the allocation of the lottery slots, the remaining PLAYOFF teams will be ordered following according to accumulated points to the end of the draft order.</p>
<p>GFHL lottery system consists of 2 ball draws with a total of 50 lottery balls in each draw to award the #1 pick overall after both draws are complete.</p>
<p>The distribution of ping-pong balls and odds of winning a single draw are as below - consistancy</p>
<ul>(1)  32nd - 12 balls = 24%</ul>
<ul>(2)  31st - 10 balls = 20%</ul>
<ul>(3)  30th -  8 balls = 16%</ul>
<ul>(4)  29th -  6 balls = 12%</ul>
<ul>(5)  28th -  4 balls =  8%</ul>
<ul>(6)  27th -  2 balls =  4%</ul>
<ul>(7)  26th -  1 balls =  2%</ul>
<ul>(8)  25th -  1 ball  =  2%</ul>
<ul>(9)  24th -  1 ball  =  2%</ul>
<ul>(10) 23rd -  1 ball  =  2%</ul>
<ul>(11) 22nd -  1 ball  =  2%</ul>
<ul>(12) 21st -  1 ball  =  2%</ul>
<ul>(13) 20th -  1 ball  =  2%</ul>
<ul>(14) 19th -  1 ball  =  2%</ul>
<p>The <b>first GFHL Lottery ball</b> draw will yield a winning selection that will move any team in the bottom 14 slots forward by seven (7) slots [as 
procedure minus 7 from the current place: if his/her ball is picked, the holder of the 14th pick goes to 7th, for example]. The selected team 
moves up and the team originally in that slot slides back one place. So in order for any of those 9-14 bottom place teams to get the #1 pick 
their single ball would have to be picked in the first draw to move them forward seven spots. Then their ball re-enters the drum to have to have 
their team's ball picked AGAIN in the second draw.</p>
<p>After the first drawing is made, the selected ball re-enters the drum, and a second lottery ball pick is made. If, however, any of top 8 teams 
have one of their balls picked in the first draw they are awarded the #1 drafting slot and it is secured. This is, once the #1 spot is secured it 
is no longer available to any team in the second draw.</p>
<p>The <b>second GFHL Lottery ball</b> draw sees the winning team's pick move up a maximum of six (6) spots [as procedure minus 6 from the current place: 
if his/her ball is picked, the holder of the 7th pick goes to 1st, for example]. If, however, the #1 overall drafting slot is secured by one of the 
top 7 teams in the first drawing, the best position that can be acquired is the #2 overall drafting slot.</p>
<p>This system preserves the bottom seven teams' claim to greater odds in acquiring the #1 overall pick in the draft, while also giving the 9-14th place 
teams a small chance by which to win it. This system also will not undermine the weaker teams claim should one acquire the #1 overall pick in the 
first lottery draw as it is secured. Any other spot remains unsecured until both draws are made.</p>
<p>Once the lottery selection has been determined, the remaining team picks are placed in priority order in association to that team's 
position in the standings from the past season (NON-PLAYOFF teams being ranked higher in the draft), worst to first. A tie in the overall standings is broken by the year-to-date stats 
server (Officepools) point totals.</p>
</div>
<br />
<div class="text">
<b><h2>The GFHL Waiver/Entry Draft:</h2></b>
<p>The GFHL waiver/entry draft is held on a one or two day schedule in the off-season. The date(s) will be determined and announced by the League Commissioner on a year-to-year basis. Please note that the third round draft selections are only for NON-PLAYOFF teams from the previous season.</p>
<p>Each draft selection is given a designated time slot. GMs get online for their appointed time slot 
and inform the Commissioner whom they would like to draft. The League website draft page is updated after 
each selection so that all GMs know what players have already been taken.</p>
<p>If a GM can not make their appointed time slot then they are required to email the League Office a 
"wish list" of players they would like. This list should be sure to have enough players on it to accommodate 
for selections prior to the appointed slot (i.e. if you are drafting at the 13th spot then make sure you have 
13 players on your list). </p>
<p>Any one team can only lose a maximum of 2 players from their roster in the draft in any given draft year. 
Teams are permitted to select one of their own exposed (unprotected) players in the draft and have that 
selection count towards one of the two players they can lose in the draft.</p>
<p>GMs may give "power of attorney" to a fellow GM to allow them to select for their team, but the League 
Office must receive confirmation from both GMs involved. If GMs do decide on this route, they are warned 
that if they are not happy with the selections their designate makes for them, the league CAN NOT step in. 
This agreement is done at the GM's own risk.</p>
</div>
<br />
<div class="text">
<b><h2>Late/Missing a draft selection:</h2></b>
<p>If you are late for your pick (no matter the reason), but within 10 minutes of the end time or your 
draft selection time, you will be allowed to pick after whomever is currently on the clock for their pick. 
If you are more than 10 minutes late (no matter the reason) from then end time of your draft time slot then 
your won't be allowed to make that selection until THE END OF THE ROUND. If you are late with your 
protection list or you are late for you draft selections your commitment level and your future in this 
league will be brought into question.</p>
</div>
<br />
<div class="text">
<b><h2>Post Draft Information:</h2></b>
<p>Following the conclusion of the GFHL waiver/entry draft, GMs are allowed ONE SIGNING PER DAY during the 
off-season. It is first come, first serve for the Free Agents. GMs have two weeks to reduce the size of 
your team rosters. After that time, if a team's roster has more than 24 players, then the roster will be 
frozen until the GM releases the required number of players to meet the limit. That is, no transactions 
can be made. If a GM fails to reduce their roster number down to the maximum limit of 24 players after the 
two weeks will be subject to the following sanctions:</p>
<ul><b>1 week late:</b> Loss of 2nd rounder </ul>
<ul><b>2 weeks late:</b> Loss of 1st rounder</ul>
<ul><b>3 weeks late:</b> Loss of next year's 1st</ul>
<ul><b>4 weeks late:</b> GM removal...new GM receives back the picks lost and has one week to make the necessary changes.</ul>
<p>If the GM has already traded away or lost a pick(s) then the League will move to the next consequence in line.</p>
<p>During the two week grace period following the GFHL waiver/entry draft, if a team is over the 24 player roster limit 
and a GM is trying to make a transaction then that GM must make an attempt to reduce their roster size (i.e. if one player 
is signed, two must be released).</p>
<p>Following the draft, players who are released are put on waivers for 48 hours and the lower standings teams have first 
shot at them. During the regular and playoff season all teams must have every roster spot on their team filled. No empty 
roster spots are permitted except during the off-season.</p>
</div>
<br />
<div class="text">
<b><h2>Use of League E-mail/MSN List...</h2></b>
<p>The purpose of this rule is to eliminate junk email/MSN messages from being passed around. This rule will work on a three strike system. With each offense, you will be punished more severely.</p>
<ul><b>Strike one:</b> loss of second round pick in the upcoming waiver/amateur draft</ul> 
<ul><b>Strike Two:</b> loss of first round pick in the upcoming waiver/amateur draft</ul>
<ul><b>Strike Three:</b> firing of the GM from the GFHL.</ul>
<p>For sending nuisance and junk email, you will start off at Strike one. For sending offensive messages and threats (even idle ones), you will start off at strike two. For serious threats, you will jump right away to strike three. In situations where the offending GM has traded away their draft selections, they will be given three days to acquire that draft selection from another team. If not, then the rules committee will select an appropriate player to be removed from the offending GM's roster.</p>
<p>If a GM is removed from his position, then the new incoming GM will be rewarded back those draft selections that were removed for previous violations. I'm hoping that this rule will never be put into practice, after all, we are all grown ups here. I know many of you have friends in the league and that will be ok if they take your junk mail. Just don't be sending junk mail or offense messages to other GM's, for most of us don't want to see it. A simple rule of thumb to follow.... if you have any doubts about whether a message is appropriate, then DON'T send it.</p>
